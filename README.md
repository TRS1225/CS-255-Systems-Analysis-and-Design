# CS-255-Systems-Analysis-and-Design
# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, is a small business looking to launch a cloud-based web service aimed at providing driver's education and on-the-road training to prospective students who are, in the near future, looking to take their driver's license test at the DMV.

The type of system they wanted designed was to be primarily distributed over the web, via a cloud-based service. Prospective students can register online, purchase an educational package, and book the reservation of their choice. However, they also allow the option for students to register over the phone, by calling in to a secretary, who would be capable of filling in their provided information. DriverPass intends to operate as a for-profit company who sees a future in the marketplace by providing a remedy to the issue of students failing their DMV testing. 

# What did you do particularly well?

I understood their business plan and developed supporting documents, as well as diagrams, which established the blueprint for DriverPass's success as a startup. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Building accurate diagrams, such as class and sequence diagrams, are a skill that gets developed over time. Developing better diagrams by repeating the same process with other, new businesses will result in more efficient diagrams.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By careful and thorough study of the DriverPass interview transcript. With a solid understanding of the content of the transcript, it wasn't difficult to visualize how users would interact with the system. It is important to consider the user's needs because the system is being designed for their use, not for the use of the system analyst. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Generally speaking, my approach designing software is incremental and iterative. Every step is planned and tested frequently throughout the process. When designing a system in the future, the best technique that I have learned of in this course is to thoroughly study and visualize what the client is requesting, preferably in the form of a finalized document. Then proceed through the 5 major phases of the SDLC.
